<!-- first clone to your repo and cd to your git repo not the folder you created.

so, you can see your main branch

crate a feature and checkout to the branch and follow the following commands 

git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin features

if it doesnt go through first set your main as origin 

git remote set-url origin <URL> -->
